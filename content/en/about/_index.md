Some physical and digital artwork produced today will make a difference in the World. 
Can anyone tell for sure whose creations will be distinguished in future times?
Time will tell.

A certificate of authenticity is a promise made by a creator. 

"It is ME, I did THIS, for YOU, and I claim : THIS is unique, it will change US." 

The ME, the YOU and the THIS should be explicite and last to make history. 

I did SOMETHING, but is was LOST or STOLEN is a creator's nightmare. As much as a collector would
cry over a lost collection of rare items burnt irreversibly. As much as we cry when a Museum is destroyed or looted, 
it affects all of US. 

UNCOPIED certificates don't reinvent the wheel. [Tally sticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick) have been around 
since the upper paleolitic, when the first forms of primary art emerged.

[Chirographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirograph) are tally sticks on paper. They have beend around for a while too : securing commercial contracts, 
important transactions, until it became impractical to fit duplicate texts onto a single sheet of parchment.

[Banksy's](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/british-museum-acquires-first-banksy-1454380) chirograph, a fake £10 note found on Pest Control certificates of authenticity, was the first work by the artist to enter the British Museum’s collection.

We would like our certificates to work for anyone : not just the FAMOUS ARTIST. 

We use recent human inventions to make chirographs practical again : barcode, qrcode and the latest (greener) generation of blockchain technology.  

Our certificates are designed to outlive us : the tally stick provides physical uniqueness to a label and four certificate copies. 
ME, YOU and US receive a physical copy of the document. UNCOPIED certificates are archived with the highest level of physical security
available. All source digital objects are stored on IPFS, a redundant digital archive. Art object identifiers are stored both with UNCOPIED 
and on the blockchain as a unique asset (also known as NFT - non fungible token). 

On [UNCOPIED.ORG](https://uncopied.org), you can issue your own certificate and NFTs. Every creator can make ORIGINAL truely UNIQUE. 

If you like this project, please contribute to our [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/uncopied), all funding 
will go to finance our IPFS infrastructure and some open source development.
